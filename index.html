    The <template> tag holds its content hidden from the client.

    The content can be visible and rendered later by using JavaScript.

    Use the <template> tag when you have HTML code you want to use over and over again, but not until you ask for it.
    To do this without the <template> tag,
    you have to create the HTML code with JavaScript to prevent the browser from rendering the code.

    /* as expected: this is ideal for when you have many different 'components' e.g.:
    an app built in React and another app built in Angular, which you both want to be present on a page.
    put/build your app in a web component, use that webcomponent in another app whereever you like.
    If however everything is built in one framework, just use that one Framework.

    if a new project built for modern browsers, no framework and just using webcomponents (and possibly Polymer)
    is also a good way to go.

    at the moment of creation, only works in Chrome, polyfills for FF, IE, Edge etc. are available.
